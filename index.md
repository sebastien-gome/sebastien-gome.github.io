   <p>
    I am a theoretical fluid dynamicist, working on turbulence in geophysical systems.
   </p>  
   <p>
    I develop analytical and numerical approaches to understand the statistics and dynamics of fluid motions, waves and large-scale structures.

<br>
I am a post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Physics at the Technion, working in
<a href="https://phsites.technion.ac.il/frishman/" target="_blank">
Anna Frishman's
</a> statistical hydrodynamics group.
Previously, I did my PhD under the supervision of <a href="https://blog.espci.fr/laurette/" target="_blank">  Laurette Tuckerman </a> and <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/dwight_barkley/home_page/" target="_blank" >  Dwight Barkley </a> in Sorbonne Université in Paris (at the <a href="https://www.pmmh.espci.fr/-Home-" target="_blank" >PMMH lab  </a>  - EPSCI Paris). 
Previously, I graduated in Mechanical Engineering at Ecole polytechnique and at Aerospace Engineering in ISAE-Supaero. 
<br>
<br>
My research interests include: out-of-equilibrium statistical physics, multiple-scale analysis, shear flows, pattern formation,
internal waves, instabilties and transition to turbulence, wave turbulence and dynamical and stochastic systems.

    <h3>Self-organization of turbulence</h3>
    <p> Sometimes, but not all the time, turbulence is organized. That is, chaotic fluctuations generate strong large-scale and persistent motions, as the ones we see in the atmosphere or the oceans. Find out how waves can lead to such "anti-diffusive" behavior <a href="/research/#self-organized">here</a>.!  </p>

    <h3> Phase transition to turbulence in shear flows </h3>
    <p> The ways that turbulence emerges in wall-bounded flows, like pipe or Couette flow, has remained a mystery for more than a century. Today, we have evidence that turbulence propagates via a percolation process described by <span class="keyword">universal statistical laws</span>. Find out more about my works on the transition to turbulence <a href="/research/#shear">here</a>.
