I am a theoretical fluid dynamicist, working on turbulence in geophysical systems.

My research interests include:

- Effect of rotation on turbulence
- Perturbative approaches and turbulent closures
- Self-organization of turbulence from waves dynamics
- Shear flows and emergence of turbulence

This website is under construction.
