   <p>
    I am a theoretical fluid dynamicist, working on turbulence in geophysical systems.
   </p>  
   <p>
    I develop analytical and numerical approaches to understand the statistics and dynamics of fluid motions, waves and large-scale structures.

I am currently a post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Physics at the Technion, working in
<a href="https://phsites.technion.ac.il/frishman/" target="_blank">
Anna Frishman's
</a> statistical hydrodynamics group.
Previously, I did my PhD under the supervision of <a href="https://blog.espci.fr/laurette/" target="_blank">  Laurette Tuckerman </a>  and <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/dwight_barkley/home_page/" target="_blank" >  Dwight Barkley </a>, in Sorbonne Université in Paris (<a href="https://www.pmmh.espci.fr/-Home-" target="_blank" > PMMH lab  </a>  /EPSCI Paris). 
Previously, I graduated both in Mechanical Engineering at Ecole polytechnique and in Aerospace Engineering in ISAE-Supaero. 

<br>
My research interests include: out-of-equilibrium statistical physics, multiple-scale analysis, shear flows, pattern formation,
internal waves, instabilties and transition to turbulence, wave turbulence and dynamical and stochastic systems.

    <h3> Phase transitions to turbulence in shear flows </h3>
    <p> The ways of emergence of turbulence in wall-bounded flows, like pipe or Couette flow, are still mostly a mystery to us. </p>
