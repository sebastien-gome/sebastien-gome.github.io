   <p>
    I am a theoretical fluid dynamicist, working on turbulence in geophysical systems.
   </p>  
   <p>
    I develop analytical and numerical approaches to undestand the statistics and dynamics of fluid motions, waves and large-scale structures.

I am currently a post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Physics at the Technion, working in [Anna Frishman's](https://phsites.technion.ac.il/frishman/){:target="_blank"} statistical hydrodynamics group.
Previously, I did my PhD under the supervision of [Laurette Tuckerman](https://blog.espci.fr/laurette/){:target="_blank"} and [Dwight Barkley](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/dwight_barkley/home_page/){:target="_blank"}, in Sorbonne Université in Paris ([PMMH lab](https://www.pmmh.espci.fr/-Home-){:target="_blank"}/EPSCI Paris).
Previously, I graduated both in Mechanical Engineering at Ecole polytechnique and in Aerospace Engineering in ISAE-Supaero, 
majoring in Fluid Dynamics and minoring in Modelisation of Complex Systems.

My research interests include:

- Effect of rotation on turbulence
- Perturbative approaches and turbulent closures
- Self-organization of turbulence from waves dynamics
- Shear flows and emergence of turbulence

    <h3>Self-organization of turbulence</h3>
    <p> Waves, large-scale coherent motions. Analytical perturbative approaches, statistical closures, coupled with simulations. </p>

    <h3> Phase transitions to turbulence in shear flows </h3>
    <p> The ways of emergence of turbulence in wall-bounded flows, like pipe or Couette flow, are still mostly a mystery to us. </p>
