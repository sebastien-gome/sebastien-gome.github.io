I am a theoretical physicist, working on statistical fluid dynamics in geophysical context.

My research interests include:

- Effect of rotation on turbulence
- Perturbative approaches and turbulent closures
- Self-organization of turbulence from waves dynamics
- Shear flows and emergence of turbulence
