   <p>
    I am a theoretical fluid dynamicist, working on turbulence in geophysical systems.
   </p>  
   <p>
    I develop analytical and numerical approaches to undestand the statistics and dynamics of fluid motions, waves and coherent structures. 
    </p>
</div>



My research interests include:

- Effect of rotation on turbulence
- Perturbative approaches and turbulent closures
- Self-organization of turbulence from waves dynamics
- Shear flows and emergence of turbulence

This website is under construction.

    <h3>Self-organization of turbulence</h3>
    <p> Waves, large-scale coherent motions. Analytical perturbative approaches, statistical closures, coupled with simulations. </p>

    <h3> Phase transitions to turbulence in shear flows </h3>
    <p> The ways of emergence of turbulence in wall-bounded flows, like pipe or Couette flow, are still mostly a mystery to us. </p>
