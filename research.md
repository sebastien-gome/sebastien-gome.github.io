My research focuses on statistical and geophysical fluid dynamics.

### 1. Self-organized turbulence {#self-organized}

When it is constrained by external forces like rotation, gravity or a magnetic field, turbulence often exhibits large-scale coherent motions which come to dominate the flow dynamics.
In idealized setups (like 2D turbulence), this remarkable property can be traced to the presence of two quadratic sign-definite quantities, dynamically conserved at scales where energy injection and dissipation are too slow or absent. This two invariants constrain energy to accumulate at large scales in the flow (in an "inverse cascade" phenomenology). 
Classical three-dimensional fluids, however, do not obey such a constraint, as they conserve energy and helicity, the latter being sign-indefinite. This causes energy to flow to small scales.
How come some three-dimensional flow exhibit large-scale motions then?

In this research, we study how solid-body rotation comes to modify 3D flows and generate large-scale, effectively two-dimensional structures (aligned with the rotation axis).
We show that rotation spontaneously generates internal waves (called inertial waves), which, when interacting with large-scale two-dimensional modes, come to conserve an additional invariant: the wave helicity for each sector of helicity sign. This additional, hidden invariant constrains the waves to generate and maintain large-scale 2D motions.
However, when rotation is sufficiently strong, 2D-waves interactions come to be depleted, due to a resonant effect. Therefore, in this limit, waves and 2D modes decouple: this is where a 3D-wave turbulent regime can be obtained, and where a purely 2D regime as well - depending on how the system is forced!
